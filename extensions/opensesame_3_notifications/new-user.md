# Welcome!

It looks like you're new to OpenSesame 3.

If you've never used OpenSesame before, I recommend that you follow the beginner tutorial. This will take a bit of time now, but will save lots of time later.

If you've used OpenSesame before, I recommend that you take a look at what's new in version 3. Don't worry: Your old experiments still work, and things have only got easier!
