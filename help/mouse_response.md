# Mouse_response items

The `mouse_response` item works analogously to the `keyboard_response` item, with the obvious difference that mouse clicks are recorded instead of key presses.

## Names of mouse buttons

Mouse buttons have a number (`1`, etc.) as well as a name (`left_button`, etc.). Both can be used to specify correct and allowed responses, but numbers will be used for logging.

- `left_button` corresponds to `1`
- `middle_button` corresponds to `2`
- `right_button` corresponds to `3`
- `scroll_up` corresponds to `4`
- `scroll_down` corresponds to `5`

For more information, see the help page of the `keyboard_response` and the documentation:
