# LabScribe_send_message 

This plugin is intended for use with LabScribe from iWorx Systems, Inc.
Creates a connection with the LabScribe program so messages can be sent from an OpenSesame experiment into labscribe to document events or changes.

The following options are available:
- *Start Connection*: Make this the first event in the experiment so the start time of the experiment is accurate. Establishes a port connection with labscribe in order to enable the sending of information from OpenSesame.
- *Send Message*: Used to send a message to labscribe by typing the message into the available text box. The time that the message was sent is also displayed in labscribe. Useful for marking changing events or labeling a current event.
- *End Connection*: Should be the last thing included in your experiment. Closes the connection with labscribe by closing the port that was opened. Records the time that the experiment ended.
