# Text_display

*Tip: [Forms](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/forms) provide a more flexible way to present text stimuli and collect text responses.*

The `text_display` item is a convenience plug-in. That is, it does nothing which could not be done using a `sketchpad` item, but is more convenient if you want to display a large portion of text.

The following options are available:

- *Duration* should be a positive integer value, 'keypress', or 'mouseclick', to wait respectively for a specified interval in milliseconds, until a key has been pressed, or until a mouse button has been clicked.
- *Foreground color* should be an English color name (e.g., 'blue') or an HTML color value (e.g., '#0000FF').
- *Background color* should be an English color name (e.g., 'blue') or an HTML color value (e.g., '#0000FF').
- *Font family* is mono, sans or serif.
- *Font size* reflects the size of the font in points.
- *Align* is either left, center, or right.
