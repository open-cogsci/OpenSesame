# Feedback items

`feedback` items can be used to inform participants of their performance. `feedback` items are very similar to `sketchpad` items, but differ in the moment at which they are prepared. `feedback` items are not prepared in advance, which means that they can contain up-to-date information about response times, etc. On the other, this also means that they may introduce a small delay in your experiment, which is why you should not use them for the presentation of time-critical displays.

One way to give feedback would be to add something the following lines of text to your `feedback` item:

	Your average response time was [avg_rt] ms
	Your accuracy was [acc] %
