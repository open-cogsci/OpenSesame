# Joystick plug-in

The JOYSTICK plug-in handles input from joystick devices, including trackballs and video-game-style gamepads. Using the joystick module of PyGame, the JOYSTICK plug-in allows for the use of a joystick with buttons, axes, trackballs, and hats.

## Options and response variables

The JOYSTICK plug-in works analogously to the KEYBOARD_RESPONSE item. For more information, see the KEYBOARD_RESPONSE-item help or visit:

## Button names

Depending on the kind of joystick or gamepad you use, a different number of buttons, axes, tracksballs, and hats are available. Please make sure you know which button corresponds to which button number (same goes for axes, hats and trackballs).
