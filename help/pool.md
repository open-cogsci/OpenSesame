# The file pool

The file pool contains all the files that are bundled with your experiment, such as images (`.png`) that are used in `sketchpad` items and sound files (`.wav` / `.ogg`) that are used in `sampler` items.

## Adding, removing and renaming

You can add files to the file pool using drag-and-drop or by clicking on the 'Add' button and selecting a file. You can remove files from the file pool by right clicking them and selecting 'Remove from pool'. You can rename files in the file pool by right clicking them and selecting 'Rename'.

## Saving the file pool

In order to save the file pool along with your experiment, you must save your experiment in `.opensesame.tar.gz` format.
