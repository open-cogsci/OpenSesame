<h1>Loop items</h1>

<p>A loop item calls another item (the 'item to run') multiple times, while varying your independent variables. Loop items are the main way to define independent variables, and to divide your experiment into trials and blocks.</p>


<h2>The loop table</h2>

<p>In the loop table you can specify variables, which are displayed as columns. You can add and remove variables using the add variable and remove variable buttons. The rows in the table correspond to cycles. A cycle corresponds to a 'level' or one unique combination of independent variables. You can specify the number of cycles by entering a number in the cycles input field. The repeat option corresponds to the number of times that all cycles should be executed. You can set this to a non-integer value. For example, by setting repeat to 0.5, half of all cycles will be executed.</p>

<p>The order option indicates whether the cycles should be executed sequentially or in random order. Randomization is complete, in the sense that the complete list of [number of cycles] x [repeat] trials is randomized. If the order is set to 'sequential', you have two more options. The skip option allows you to skip the first X number of cycles. This can be convenient, for example when you want to resume a previously interrupted session. You can also check the offset mode checkbox. If offset mode is enabled, the skipped cycles are not really skipped, but executed at the end of the loop. This can be convenient if you want each participant to start at a different cycle, but to keep the overall length of the loop equal.
Using functions

Most of the time you will enter static values into the loop table. For example, you may have a variable called 'cue', which is either 'right' or 'left'. However, you can also use functions instead of static values. This is handled, similarly as in most spreadsheets, by prepending an '=' character. For example, to draw a random number between 0 and 100, you can enter the following into a cell in the loop table:
=randint(0,100)
More generally,you can enter any valid Python statement after the '=' sign. An overview of of useful functions can be found in the Python documentation:
Random functions: http://docs.python.org/library/random.html
Mathematical: http://docs.python.org/library/math.html
Convenient ways of creating a large loop table

If you have multiple variables, each with multiple levels, it is a daunting task to manually create the entire loop table.
In this case you may want to use the variable wizard, which can be started by clicking on the variable wizard button at the top right of the table. In the variable wizard you can specify your variables and the levels of your variables. OpenSesame will automatically fill the loop table with all possible combinations.
You can also prepare your loop variables in your favorite spreadsheet (e.g., OpenOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel) and paste it into the loop table.
