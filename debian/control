Description: graphical experiment builder for the social sciences
 This graphical environment provides an easy to use, point-and-click interface
 for creating psychological experiments. In addition to a powerful sketchpad for
 creating visual stimuli, OpenSesame features a sampler and synthesizer for
 sound playback. For more complex tasks, OpenSesame supports Python
 scripting using the built-in editor with syntax highlighting.
