	desc: |
		If you insert the srbox plugin at the start of your experiment, an
		instance of `libsrbox` automatically becomes part of the experiment
		object and can be accessed from within an inline_script item as
		`exp.srbox`.

		__Important note 1:__

		If you do not specify a device, the plug-in will try to autodetect the
		SR Box port. However, on some systems this freezes the experiment, so
		it is better to explicitly specify a device.

		__Important note 2:__

		You need to call [libsrbox.start] to put the SR Box in sending mode,
		before calling [libsrbox.get_button_press] to collect a button press.
