	desc: |
		The `Mouse` class is used to collect mouse input. You generally create a
		`Mouse` object with the `Mouse()` factory function, as described in the
		section [Creating a Mouse](#creating-a-mouse).

		__Example:__

		~~~ .python
		# Draw a 'fixation-dot mouse cursor' until a button is clicked
		my_mouse = Mouse()
		my_canvas = Canvas()
		while True:
			button, position, timestamp = my_mouse.get_click(timeout=20)
			if button is not None:
				break
			(x,y), time = my_mouse.get_pos()
			my_canvas.clear()
			my_canvas.fixdot(x, y)
			my_canvas.show()
		~~~

		[TOC]

		##Â Things to know

		### Creating a Mouse

		You generally create a `Mouse` with the `Mouse()` factory function:

		~~~ .python
		my_mouse = Mouse()
		~~~

		Optionally, you can pass [Response keywords](#response-keywords) to
		`Mouse()` to set the default behavior:

		~~~ .python
		my_mouse = Mouse(timeout=2000)
		~~~

		### Coordinates

		- When *Uniform coordinates* is set to 'yes', coordinates are
		  relative to the center of the display. That is, (0,0) is the center.
		  This is the default as of OpenSesame 3.0.0.
		- When *Uniform coordinates* is set to 'no', coordinates are relative to
		  the top-left of the display. That is, (0,0) is the top-left. This was
		  the default in OpenSesame 2.9.X and earlier.

		### Button numbers

		Mouse buttons are numbered as follows:

		1. Left button
		2. Middle button
		3. Right button
		4. Scroll up
		5. Scroll down

		### Touch screens

		When working with a touch screen, a touch is registered as button 1
		(left button).

		### Response keywords

		Functions that accept `**resp_args` take the following keyword
		arguments:

		- `timeout` specifies a timeout value in milliseconds, or is set to
		  `None` to disable the timeout.
		- `buttonlist` specifies a list of buttons that are accepted, or is set
		  to `None` accept all buttons.
		- `visible` indicates whether the mouse cursor becomes visible when a
		  click is collected (`True` or `False`). To immediately change cursor
		  visibility, use [mouse.show_cursor].

		~~~ .python
		# Get a left or right button press with a timeout of 3000 ms
		my_mouse = Mouse()
		button, time = my_mouse.get_click(buttonlist=[1,3], timeout=3000)
		~~~

		Response keywords only affect the current operation (except when passed
		to [mouse.\_\_init\_\_][__init__]). To change the behavior for all
		subsequent operations, set the response properties directly:

		~~~ .python
		# Get two left or right presses with a 5000 ms timeout
		my_mouse = Mouse()
		my_mouse.buttonlist = [1,3]
		my_mouse.timeout = 5000
		button1, time1 = my_mouse.get_click()
		button2, time2 = my_mouse.get_click()
		~~~

		Or pass the response keywords to [mouse.\_\_init\_\_][__init__]:

		~~~ .python
		# Get two left or right presses with a 5000 ms timeout
		my_mouse = Mouse(buttonlist=[1,3], timeout=5000)
		button1, time1 = my_mouse.get_click()
		button2, time2 = my_mouse.get_click()
		~~~
