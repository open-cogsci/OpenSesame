		The `mouse` class is used to collect mouse input.

		__Important note:__

		When using a `mouse` all coordinates are specified relative to the
		top-left of the display, and not, as in `sketchpad`s, relative to the
		display center. For example, the following script will determine the
		deviation of a mouse click relative to the display center.

		__Example:__

		~~~ {.python}
		from openexp.mouse import mouse
		from openexp.canvas import canvas
		my_mouse = mouse(exp)
		my_canvas = canvas(exp)
		while True:
			button, position, timestamp = my_mouse.get_click(timeout=20)
			if button != None:
				break
			pos, time = my_mouse.get_pos()
			my_canvas.clear()
			my_canvas.fixdot(pos[0], pos[1])
			my_canvas.show()
		~~~

			arg_visible: |
				`True` to show the cursor, `False` to hide. (If you are using the

				visible. For a workaround, see
