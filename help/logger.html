<H1 CLASS="western">Logger items</H1>
<P>Typically, you will not only want participants to provide
responses during an experiment, you will also want to log those
responses to a data file for analysis. This is where the logger item
comes in.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Selecting variables</H2>
<P>In the logger item you can indicate which variables you wish to
log. By default the logger tries to autodetect and log all variables.
This is a safe bet, but results in large datafiles, with lots of
unnecessary information. 
</P>
<P>If you deselect the autodetect option, you can select variables
from the list, which contains all (global) variables that OpenSesame
is aware of. If, for some reason, the variable that you want to log
does not appear in the list, you can add it using the <B>Add custom
variable</B> button.</P>
<P>If you are unsure which variables you want to log, you can click
on the <B>Smart select</B> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">button,
which will select all variables that are likely to be of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">By default, the experiment is
aborted if OpenSesame attempts to log a variable that has not been
set. You can change this by enabling the </SPAN><B>Use 'NA' for
variables that have not been set option</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">,
in which case missing variables are assigned the value 'NA'. This is
convenient if you want to log a variable that is set only later in
the experiment.</SPAN></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><B>Special variables</B></H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>time_[name of item]</B> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">variables
	contain the timestamp of when an item has been run for the last
	time. This can be useful if you have doubts about the timing of your
	experiment.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P><B>count_[name of item]</B> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">variables
	contain the number of times that an item has been run. This can be
	useful as a trial or block counter. </SPAN>
	</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">Format of the logfile</H2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">The logfile is in plain-text,
comma-separated format. This format can be viewed in most
text-editors (although Windows Notepad may not handle the
line-endings properly) and spreadsheets.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Merging data files</H2>
<P>If you prefer to have all participant data in a single
spreadsheet, you can merge the OpenSesame logfiles using the online
spreadsheet merger
